A python program to study longest congruent series of boxes and noncongruent series of boxes in a loopy game.


    The purpose of the program is to analyze data of loopy games played.

    Loopy is one game of the Simon Tatham Puzzle Collection, https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/

    During my many years of playing the game, I have always had a hankering to review the longest contiguous
series of boxes and the non-contiguous series of boxes. So I've always tried other approaches to doing this.
Then, both during my marriage and after, I had wanted to program something, but life always seemed to get in
the way. Welp, after my marriage ended, I finally became free to attempt it and I needed to find a new
career, plus python looked promising. So I began to study python and started to write this little proggy.
